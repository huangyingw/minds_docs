## Working with Minds in GitLab

The [Git/GitLab documentation](guides/git.md) explains our team workflow process and labelling guidelines. Make sure you follow these guidelines before submitting an issue or merge request.

## Submitting a merge request (MR)

We welcome community contributions to our open-source code repositories. By signing a contributor license agreement (CLA), we ensure that the community is free to use your contributions.

Before submitting an MR, make sure you have:

1. Reviewed the [AGPLv3 license](contributing/license.md)
2. Signed the <a href="https://na3.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=e9c0907f-7056-403e-9972-0caad4ced5b6&env=na3-eu1&v=2"> Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>

## Submitting an issue

In most cases, issues submitted by the community will either be bugs or feature requests, submitted [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/issues). If you have the required permissions, you can apply labels to a bug or feature yourself. If not, tag a [member of staff](https://gitlab.com/groups/minds/-/group_members) in a comment on the issue page (or post in the [Help & Support](https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/100000000000000681/feed) group) and we will take care of it as soon as possible.

- log a **bug** when something has gone wrong in the system. Before you log a bug, search through existing issues to make sure it hasn't already been reported. Use the bug template provided in GitLab and fill it out with as much information as possible - especially platform details and steps to reproduce. The more information we have, the more likely we will be able to replicate the problem and find a way to fix it.

- log a **feature request** to suggest we add something that doesn't already exist on the site. Be as descriptive as possible. We welcome mock-ups and even rough sketches in notebooks if they help illustrate your idea.

## Earn token rewards for contributing

Developers who find bugs or contribute code or documentation may qualify for Minds token rewards. All developer contributions will first be reviewed by the Minds staff to determine if they qualify for a reward.
