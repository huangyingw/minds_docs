## Creating an issue

### Feature or Bug?

As a rule of thumb, log as a feature request if it does not already exist in the system and log as a bug if something has gone wrong in the system.

### Logging a Bug

For all bugs, it is important that you use the bug template when creating an issue and fill it out with as much information as possible. Try not to leave anything missing, especially platform details, and steps to reproduce - else we may have trouble replicating the issue on our end.

### Logging a feature request

For feature requests, until we have a template in place, you should simply try your best to be as descriptive as possible. If its a visual feature, we welcome mock-ups and even rough sketches in notebooks if they help illustrate your idea.

### Bug Life Cycle

Bugs generally start off in the bug triage system. The bug triage system allows us to identify and properly document incoming bugs. This means that when they are escalated from (T - Triage) to (T - Bug) label, they should contain the information necessary for a developer to complete the task.

### Labelling
If you have the required permissions, you can label a bug or feature yourself. If this is not possible, please tag a member of staff and we will tag it for you as quickly as possible. If your entry has fallen between the cracks, please post in Help and Support and we will take care of it as soon as we possibly can.

## Priorities

| **`Priority::2 - Normal`** | To be allocated an epic where possible |
| **`Priority::3 - Nice to have`** | a low priority task or issue, potentially good for the community to tackle. |
| **`Priority::4 - Trivial`** | Generally for bugs or minor changes. |

## Progress
