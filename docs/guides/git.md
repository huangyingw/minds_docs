## Branches vs Forks

**Branches** are preferred over forks, as they integrate with the **Review/Sandbox** environments.

Branch names should be no more that **20 characters** long and include one of the following prefixes:

- **fix/** *(also include the issue number)*
- **chore/** *(also include the issue number)*
- **feat/**
- **refactor/**
- **epic/** *(also include the epic number)*

## Merge Requests

Ensure that you clearly explain the purpose of the merge request, and reference the original issue.
