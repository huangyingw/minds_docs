Minds is a distributed team located on both sides of the Atlantic. We communicate via [Zulip](https://zulip.com), [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) and Minds Gatherings (video chat).

## Squads

### Video Scrums

[Click here](https://www.minds.com/groups/profile/569521254306951168/feed) to join the calls.

Each squad has a video call twice per week. The squad answers the following questions:

1) What did you yesterday
2) What are you going to do today
3) Are there any issues

### Asynchronous Scrums 

On days where the squad does not have a video call scheduled, the scrum will be performed offline and still follow the same 3 question patterns as noted above.

## Coffee Chats

Optional daily 30 minute meetings where team members can hop in and out, discuss issues or share knowledge. Time TBC.

## QA
